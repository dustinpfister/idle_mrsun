# server-static

Although this is very much an electionjs applaction, I do still want to make a 'browser' version of this game as well of course. So I have this static server script that will host the browser version of the game over a local network. This is mainly for testing reasons on my end, but it is also nice to be able to just host the game on a network also of source

I started with the source code found [here](https://gist.github.com/anukulSingh/88e20175cf37151773fbbbb194fb460f) then hacked over the code as needed. I have made scripts like this in the past but I think I would like to have a fresh start with this. At the time of this writing I have not added expresss to the stack so as long as that is the case I am going to need some kind of vanilla js soution.
