# mrsun-biology

I would like to have life be a part of this mrsun world. So then I will need some code that will do the following.

* provide conditions that will cuase life to start in a land section objects to begin with
* provide conditions that will case all life in a section to die
* how blank blocks in the section will change as long as life is active in the section
* how the main game delta mana value will be effected by 'life' type blocks
